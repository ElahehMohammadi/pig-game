a fun game to play with your friend

game tutorial:
Players take turns rolling the two dice as many times as they want within each round. Keep adding up what they've rolled, and keep a running total until they decide to stop. When a player decides to stop, they bank their total by recording their score.

But be careful â€“ if you roll a 1, your turn ends and you get zero for that round and your turn ends.

player who has a total larger than 20 wins.
